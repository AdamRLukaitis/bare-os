###bare-os

Bare metal software for RaspberryPi (I would not seriously call it an operating system)

Target is ARM, not the GPU. Framebuffer display, serial connection and some other things are working.

I am a bit disappointed with the Pi, as the GPU is hard to come by and so I am not really bare-metal.

So this is purely experimental and I am lacking time to advance with it.
